- **Enabled for specific groups except for certain groups**: Here,
  members of the specified security groups are allowed to use this
  feature, unless they also belong to an excluded group. This approach
  ensures that certain users don't have access to the feature even if
  they're in the allowed group. The most restrictive setting for a user
  applies.
